00:01 Before we continue, I want to make sure you actually have 
00:04 a working pip install at this point, and that it's fully up to date. 
00:07 So let's talk about installing pip if it's not already on your system 
00:11 and then also how you can upgrade to the latest version of pip. 
00:14 So all modern versions of Python 2 and Python 3 
00:18 are going to include pip by default. 
00:21 Now of course that doesn't really help you if the pip command doesn't work 
00:24 in your system right now, so let's talk about what you can do 
00:27 if pip is not available on your system yet. 
00:31 The first option to get a working pip install on your system 
00:34 would be to upgrade to a more modern version of Python 
00:37 which is automatically going to include the latest version of pip. 
00:40 Now, this would be my preferred option, but of course, 
00:44 if you're working with older legacy versions of Python 
00:47 and you have a bunch of code running on them already, 
00:50 then that isn't really the best option. 
00:53 So, option 2 would be to add pip to your existing Python install,
00:57 and that is definitely possible, I am going to show you how to do that now. 
01:01 So in a nutshell, on Mac OS and Windows, 
01:04 you would have to download a so called bootstrap script, called get-pip.py. 
01:09 And you would download that through a browser 
01:12 or through a command line tool like perl, 
01:15 and once you've downloaded the get pip script, 
01:18 you would run it with the Python interpreter. 
01:21 So you would just go to the terminal and run something like Python get-pip.py 
01:25 and the get pip script would then automatically install 
01:28 and set up pip on your system. 
01:31 Now, on most versions of Linux, 
01:34 especially if you're using a version based on debian Linux like Ubuntu, 
01:37 you would actually go through the system package manager to install pip. 
01:41 To do that, you would first run a command like sudo apt update 
01:45 to refresh your system's package manger and then you would follow up 
01:49 with sudo apt install python-pip, and running that command 
01:54 would add pip to your existing Python install. 
01:57 Now adding pip to an existing Python install is a little bit fiddly, 
02:01 there are a couple of edge cases you need to look out for, 
02:05 one resource that I can recommend to learn more 
02:07 about how to do this, is the Python packaging guide. 
02:11 You can find it at packaging.python.org.
02:15 Let's make sure you're running an up to date version of pip on your system. 
02:18 Modern versions of Python will always include the latest pip version
02:22 that came out when the Python release was prepared. 
02:25 But, pip and Python are actually fully independent, 
02:29 so you can update pip without updating Python for example. 
02:33 Depending on the operating system that you're on, 
02:36 the steps you need to take to update pip are slightly different. 
02:40 On Mac OS and Windows you would typically just use the pip command 
02:44 to tell pip to upgrade itself, and I am going to give you 
02:47 a live demo of how to do that shortly. 
02:50 On a Linux system where you are using the system package manager 
02:54 to manage your Python install, you would typically upgrade pip through that, 
02:58 so you wouldn't actually use the pip command to upgrade pip 
03:01 but you would just tell the system package manager to update your install of pip.
03:06 I am going to give you a live demo of how that upgrade process works. 
03:10 So I am back here in my Mac OS terminal 
03:14 and I've prepared this command here, 
03:17 so I am running this command, sudo pip install-- upgrade pip setup tools. 
03:23 And what this is going to do, it's basically telling pip to upgrade itself. 
03:28 Set up tools here is just another dependency for pip 
03:31 and part of the package management system in Python. 
03:35 So typically, you would update both of them at the same time. 
03:38 I am going to go ahead and run this command now, 
03:41 so because I am running this with sudo, I need to enter my account password, 
03:44 okay, so this worked, and what pip is telling us here is that 
03:48 essentially everything is up to date. 
03:51 So any time you want to update pip to the latest version in the future, 
03:54 you would just rerun that command, and then if there is an update 
03:57 pip would install it and upgrade itself to the latest version.
