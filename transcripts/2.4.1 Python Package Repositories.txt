00:01 An important part of dependency management is of course 
00:04 the ability to store packages somewhere 
00:07 so that you or other people can install them. 
00:10 Now, let's talk about Python package repositories. 
00:14 Python packages are collected in so called software repositories. 
00:18 The biggest, or official software repository in Python is called PyPi. 
00:23 It's also sometimes called The Cheese Shop, 
00:27 because Python developers just love their Monty Python references. 
00:32 Developers can register for a free PyPi account 
00:35 and then submit new packages to the repository. 
00:39 And once a package appears in PyPi, everyone else can install it through pip, 
00:43 so this is a really popular method to distribute open source Python packages, 
00:47 and there are literally tens of thousands of packages available for free, 
00:51 that you could just install through pip. 
00:55 And by the way, there is no review or QA process for packages submitted to PyPi. 
01:00 So whenever you install a package from PyPi, 
01:03 it makes sense to invest some time into do diligence work 
01:06 and reviewing what's available, so that you get a quality piece of software. 
01:10 Let's search for some packages on PyPi. 
01:14 We're going to take a look at the PyPi website now,
01:17 and you can find it at pypi.python.org. 
01:21 Lets fire up a browser and then take a look at the PyPi website. 
01:26 Alright, this is PyPi, you can see some stats here so right now,
01:31 they are close to a 100 thousand packages available here, on PyPi,
01:35 and when you scroll down, you can see sort of a update log 
01:39 of recently updated packages as people pushed them to the package repository 
01:44 you can see here what was updated. 
01:47 And of course, one of the most important parts of the site here is the search box. 
01:51 So into the search box, you can enter keywords 
01:54 and basically do a full tech search on the descriptions 
01:58 and the metadata for the packages available on PyPi, 
02:01 so you've probably heard of the really popular Requests package, 
02:05 which is a HTTP download library, so I am going to go ahead 
02:09 and search for Requests here. 
02:12 Okay, so these are the search results for Requests, 
02:15 and what is interesting here is that the actual Requests library
02:18 that I was looking for, is not the number one search result, right,
02:22 because this is just doing a search across all of the descriptions 
02:25 and the metadata in all of the available packages. 
02:28 So I get some very exhaustive results here, and you can see here 
02:32 as I scroll down this is a really long list, because, 
02:34 obviously the keyword Requests seems to be quite popular. 
02:38 Alright, so I am going to go ahead and click on the Requests library here, 
02:43 because, every package in PyPi actually has its own landing page, 
02:48 so it has its own page on PyPi where the developers can host the readme 
02:53 and give some links to the documentation or release history, and stuff like that. 
03:00 So what you can see here is that right now 
03:04 I am looking at the specific version of Requests, 
03:06 and you can also see that reflected here in the url, 
03:09 so this will be a pypi-name of the library-the version. 
03:13 So this is handy if you ever want to link to a specific library 
03:17 or a specific version of library, because you can just use that link. 
03:20 This is the readme file or the description 
03:24 that the creators of the Requests library have put together. 
03:27 So the contents of this description here largely depend 
03:31 on the information that the library creators put in. 
03:36 Sometimes the formatting as it's displayed on the PyPi website isn't perfect, 
03:39 so you are going to get these super blown up images here, just ignore that for now. 
03:43 Actually, what I wanted to show you is when you scroll all the way down here, 
03:49 there will always be the summary with metadata 
03:55 about the package that you are looking at, 
03:58 and this is often very useful if you want to find the homepage 
04:01 for a specific project or if you want to identify its author 
04:04 or if you are interested in the license that the code is under. 
04:10 Then, also, you can see the categories the code is filed under, 
04:14 or the library it was filed under, and then also what other dependencies 
04:17 or secondary dependencies that library requires. 
04:21 To me, the most useful information is usually these top 3 items here, 
04:24 I want to know about the library author, 
04:27 I usually take a look at the library home page 
04:31 and then I also want to know what license the software is under. 
04:34 And of course, you could also click through these categories here 
04:37 and maybe find some interesting packages that way. 
04:40 Okay, that's it for PyPi. 
04:44 You can also search for packages from the command line, 
04:47 using the pip search command. 
04:49 Usually I would recommend that you stick with the PyPi website though. 
04:53 The pip command doesn't really give you very much information 
04:56 about those search results so it's just the package name 
04:59 and then a very brief description, which can be useful 
05:02 but as you've seen in the PyPi demo, oftentimes, 
05:05 a single keyword can lead to many search results 
05:08 so it's a little bit hard to untangle that from the command line 
05:12 if you only have limited information available. 
05:15 Nevertheless, that feature exists and it can be useful in a pinch.
