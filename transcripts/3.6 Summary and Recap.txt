00:01 Congratulations on completing the virtual environments module in the course. 
00:04 Here is what you covered. 
00:06 You learned what virtual environments are, 
00:08 you learned how to create and activate them, 
00:10 you learned how to install packages into a virtual environment. 
00:14 And you've also learned how to deactivate 
00:16 and even destroy a virtual environment. 
00:18 And last, I showed you some tricks 
00:21 on how you can optimize your virtual environment workflow 
00:24 and make it a little bit more efficient. 
00:26 In the last few lectures you learned about virtual environments 
00:28 and how they can help you keep your project dependencies under control. 
00:32 Virtual environments help keep your project dependencies isolated
00:37 so that you can avoid version conflicts between packages 
00:40 and different versions of the Python runtime. 
00:43 So in a nutshell, a virtual environment allows you to use 
00:46 different versions of the same package, 
00:48 and different versions of Python depending on a project that you're working on.
00:54  And as a best practice, all of your Python projects 
00:57 should use virtual environments to store their dependencies.
