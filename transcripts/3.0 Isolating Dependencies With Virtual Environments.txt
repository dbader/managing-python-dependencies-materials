00:01 In this part of the course, you'll learn how to isolate your Python dependencies 
00:04 using so called virtual environments. 
00:07 Here is where you are right now in the course.
00:11 And this is what you are going to cover in the upcoming module in the course. 
00:17 You are going to learn about virtual environments, 
00:20 what they are, how they work, and what they are good for. 
00:23 Next, you are going to learn how to create 
00:26 and activate a virtual environment on your system,
00:29 after that, you're going to learn how to install packages into a virtual environment; 
00:32 you'll also learn how to deactivate virtual environments 
00:36 and how to completely delete them again. 
00:39 And last, I am going to show you some tips in my personal workflow 
00:42 that I use to make working with virtual environments a little bit more efficient. 
00:46 Okay, ready? Let's jump right in! 
00:49 So we just learned that Python has a powerful package management system. 
00:53 What do we need that isolation for? 
00:56 The thing is that by default, pip installs all packages in a single shared environment, 
01:01 which means that if you need different versions of Python packages,
01:05 there are going to be version conflicts. 
01:08 Here is an example. Imagine you are working on two projects. 
01:12 Project one needs a specific version of Django, let's say version 1.8, 
01:17 and it also needs a specific version of the Requests library, let's say version 2.0. 
01:22 Now, the other project, project 2, needs a completely different version of Django,
01:28 and it also needs a different version of Requests. 
01:31 Now if all of your packages need to be installed into the same shared environment, 
01:36 there are going to be version conflicts between these packages. 
01:40 Another kind of version conflict you might face is that 
01:43 let's say you are working on one project that actually needs Python 2.7 to run, 
01:48 and all of your new development happens in Python 3. 
01:52 So, maybe you're working on another project 
01:55 that actually requires Python 3.6 to run.
01:58 How do you resolve these version conflicts? 
02:02 Virtual environments are really helpful tool that can help you with this problem, 
02:07 so a virtual environment allows you to isolate 
02:10 all of your Python dependencies by project, 
02:13 and this works for packages 
02:15 and also for different versions of the Python interpreter. 
02:18 So you can think of these virtual environments 
02:21 as individual sand boxes for each project.
